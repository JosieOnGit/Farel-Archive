        <h1>Heads and alinea's</h1>
        <p>In an HTML document there are heads and alinea's, divided on a clear way between one another</p>

        <h2>Heads</h2>
        <p>You can use heads to give your text a title. That way, the reader of the document knows what your document is about.<br>
        You can also use subheads to point out pieces in your text. HTML support this until the sixth level</p>
